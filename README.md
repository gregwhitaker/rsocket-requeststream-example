# rsocket-requeststream-example
An example of using the request-stream interaction model in [RSocket](http://rsocket.io).

This example uses the `count-client` to send a request to stream the numbers `1` through `10` back from the `count-service` using RSocket.

## Building the Example
Run the following command to build the example:

    ./gradlew clean build
    
## Running the Example
Follow the steps below to run the example:

1. Run the following command to start the `count-service`:

        ./gradlew :count-service:run
        
2. In a new terminal, run the following command to start the `count-client` and request integers `1` to `10`:

        ./gradlew :count-client:run
        
    If successful, you will see the following in the terminal:

        > Task :count-client:run
